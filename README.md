# Koondelick
An organiser app made with Qt Widgets/C++. It's not completed yet, but most of the features have been implemented so it should be at least usable.

<b>Features</b>:
* basic functionality: add and manage tasks, breaks, notes (WIP)
* portability (WIP, currently works on Linux and Windows)
* material-ish design
* statistics (WIP)

## Description
You'll probably be able to tell what this program does just by using it or looking at the screenshots. However, there is one thing that might confuse you: to create a task you need to select task template and set the start time and duration. Further, any change made to task template will affect the corresponding tasks. 

## Application architecture
